  <h3>Vote YES on Measure E to Preserve Local Parks and Open Space</h3>
  <p>Citizens for Parks and Open Space Preservation is a grassroots organization of environmental leaders, families and local business dedicated to continuing vital open space funding to protect beaches, parks, wildlife habitat and natural areas in the Monterey
    Peninsula Regional Park District. The scenic beauty of our local parks and open space in Seaside, Marina, Monterey, Pacific Grove, Del Rey Oaks, Carmel and throughout the Carmel Valley and Big Sur Coast is integral to our high quality of life on the
    Monterey Peninsula.</p>
  <p>Your help is essential in preserving the natural beauty of our area for future generations. Get involved by signing up to help spread the word about critical local funding, or donate to support our grassroots, volunteer-led campaign.</p>
  <p>Passing this measure will be a community-based, volunteer effort. We need at least
    <br>two-thirds of local voters to vote <strong>YES on Measure E </strong> in order to win. That is why we count on people like you to volunteer and give a few hours of your time to protect the nature in our backyard.</p>
