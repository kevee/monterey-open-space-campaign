    Quote: 'Parks and open space make life better for everyone.  The legacy of open space preservation, the free access to District parklands enjoyed by thousands of Montetey County residents on a yearly basis, and all of the outdoor education opportunities offered by MPRPD - these are just some of the reasons I am enthusiastically supporting Measure E.
