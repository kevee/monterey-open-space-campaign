    Quote: 'Public lands protect clean air, fresh water, agricultural pollinators, recreational opportunities and most importantly, habitat for native plants and wildlife. Proximity to protected public lands has been directly correlated to higher mean income levels and rising property values (Headwaters Economics, 2012). For homeowners fortunate enough to reside within the spectacular Monterey Peninsula Regional Parks District, the minimal funding authorized by Measure E is a wise investment, plain and simple.'
