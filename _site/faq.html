  <h3>How does local funding help preserve and protect parks, open space and natural areas on the Monterey Peninsula?</h3>
  <p>MPRPD is able to preserve and protect various natural areas and parks thanks largely to voter-approved local funding. This source of funding is crucial to protecting, preserving and enhancing our beautiful local parks and natural areas for future generations.
    However, MPRPD’s local funding — more than $1 million annually and nearly 20 percent of MPRPD’s budget for parks, trails and recreation — is set to expire soon. </p>
  <h3>Does voting YES increase my taxes?</h3>
  <p>No. The measure will continue funding for local and regional parks without increasing existing tax rates, currently $25.26 per year for most homeowners. To read the full text of the measure that the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District Board of
    Directors unanimously voted to place on the November ballot, visit www.MPRPD.org.</p>
  <h3>Why should I vote YES to continue local funding?</h3>
  <p>Renewed funding will help preserve the natural beauty of our area for future generations. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to safeguard parks and open space so that they can enjoy them the same way that we do. In today’s digital age, it is
    more important than ever that we preserve natural outdoor areas so children can interact with our environment, promoting their physical health and well-being. The scenic beauty of the Monterey Peninsula goes hand in hand with our high quality of life.
    It is important that we protect it for generations to come.</p>
  <h3>How specifically will this measure help support local parks and open space?</h3>
  <p>Vote YES to continue funding for local and regional parks without increasing existing tax rates, generating $1.2 million annually to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain water quality in rivers, creeks and streams </li>
    <li>Permanently preserve beaches and natural coastal areas</li>
    <li>Permanently protect our area’s remaining redwood and Monterey pine forests</li>
    <li>Protect marine, bird and wildlife habitat</li>
    <li>Preserve natural areas and open space</li>
    <li>Provide more educational and recreational programs for youth</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How can I be sure that local funding will be spent as promised?</h3>
  <p>An independent Citizens Oversight Committee annually reviews the use of these funds, and has given its stamp of approval every year since voters first approved this funding in 2004. To view these reports, you can
    <a href="http://mprpd.org">visit MRPRD’s website</a> .</p>
  <h3>Can any funds from the measure be taken away by the state?</h3>
  <p>No. By law, none of the funds generated from the measure can be taken by the State.</p>
  <h3>Will these funds allow the District to accomplish new goals and projects?</h3>
  <p>The expiring assessment provides over $1 million annually for the District to permanently protect and maintain access to open space, beaches, coastal lands and wildlife habitat and improve local parks and playgrounds. If this funding disappears, it
    will significantly affect both the status quo and future plans for the District. Specifically, funding will be cut from the Grants Program, which allows MPRPD to partner with local agencies and organizations on new projects every year to establish
    and protect local parks, open space and recreational opportunities. Loss of this funding will also force the District to scale back or slow down many of its current plans to increase local park and trail access. </p>
  <h3>When can I vote YES?</h3>
  <p>The measure will be on the November 8, 2016 ballot. All registered voters within MPRPD borders will be eligible to vote on the measure. Absentee voters should expect to receive their ballot in the mail the week of October 10. The deadline to register
    to vote in this election is October 24. The measure must receive two-thirds approval in order to pass.</p>
