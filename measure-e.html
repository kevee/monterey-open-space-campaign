  <p>This is the full text of ballot measure E
    <br>Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District
    <br><strong>Special tax for parks, open space, and costal preservation</strong> </p>
  <p>The Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District (the “District”) is a public agency, separate from the County or any city, which was formed by Monterey County voters in 1972 to specifically protect open space and provide recreational opportunities in
    the Monterey Peninsula. Since 1972, the District has helped to protect over 13,000 acres of parks, recreational areas and open space lands and helped create the Monterey Bay Coastal Trail.</p>
  <p>The purpose of the District is to acquire, preserve, protect, restore, enhance and maintain parks, open spaces, trails, wildlife areas, creeks and streams, shorelines, and watershed lands in rural and urban areas throughout the Monterey Peninsula.
    <br>In order to continue providing these services, the District proposes to replace the existing benefit assessment with a special tax on each taxable parcel of land within the District at the same annual rates as the expiring benefit assessment. The
    rates for the first year are as follows:</p>
  <h2>Tax zone a</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Developed Single Family Residential</strong>  - $25.26 per Residential Unit</li>
    <li><strong>Developed Multi-family Residential, including Mobile Home Parks</strong>  - $11.62 per Residential Unit up to 20 units, then $2.53 for every unit thereafter</li>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Developed Single Family Residential - </strong> $12.63 per Residential Unit</li>
    <li><strong>Developed Multi-family Residential, including Mobile Home Parks - </strong> $5.81 per Residential Unit up to 20 units, then $1.26 for every unit thereafter</li>
    <li><strong>Developed Condominium Residential - </strong> $10.23 per Residential Unit</li>
    <li><strong>Developed Mobile Home on Separate Lot - </strong> $6.95 per Residential Unit</li>
    <li><strong>Developed Commercial/Industrial Property - </strong> $6.32 per Fraction Acre or portion thereof up to 5 acres, then $6.32 per Acre or portion thereof for every Acre thereafter</li>
    <li><strong>Developed Office Property - </strong> $17.93 per Fraction Acre or portion thereof up to 5 acres, then $17.93 per Acre or portion thereof for every Acre thereafter</li>

    <li><strong>Vacant Property - </strong> $6.32 per Parcel</li>

  </ul>
  <p>This special tax will ensure the continued protection of local open space, coastal lands, beaches, creeks, rivers, wildlife habitat, and natural beauty of our area as well as maintain/improve neighborhood parks, trails, playgrounds and increase recreational
    access to natural areas. </p>
  <p>The special tax revenue shall be allocated by the following percentage; 70% of the annual special tax revenue generated within the CFD shall be allocated to costs of Services provided while the remaining 30% of special tax revenue shall be allocated
    to costs of Facilities. </p>
  <p>To ensure these revenues keep pace with the cost of providing these services, the special tax may be adjusted each fiscal year in an amount equal to the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers in the San Francisco-Oakland-San
    Jose metropolitan area (CPI-U) as published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics; provided, however, that the portion of the revenue generated from the special taxes that is allocated to Facilities shall not be increased by
    more than two percent (2%) in any single year, and the portion of the revenue generated from the special taxes that is allocated to Services shall not be increased by more than three percent (3%) in any single year. Under no circumstances can the
    adjustment be enacted without the proposed modification being placed on the agenda of a Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District Board of Directors regular meeting providing for public input and discussion. </p>
  <p>If approved by the voters, the District’s appropriations limit will be increased by the amount of this voter-approved tax.
    <br>The revenue shall be deposited into a separate account for the District, in accordance with Government Code Section 50075.1, and shall be expended according to a plan developed annually, and approved and adopted by the Monterey Peninsula Regional
    Park District Board of Directors (the “Board”). A citizens oversight committee appointed by the Board will review and report on the expenditures.</p>
  <p>The District will file an annual report with its Board, which shall comply with the accountability measures established in Government Code Sections 50075.1, et seq.</p>
  <p>Any owner assessed may appeal the determination concerning the nature of use of the property or the calculation of the tax by filing a notice of appeal with the District. Any appeal shall be filed by April 10 of the year for which the tax is levied.
